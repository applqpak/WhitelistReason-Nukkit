# WhitelistReason-Nukkit
Port of my "WhitelistReason" plugin to Nukkit! (Along with a lot of fixes)

##How do I download?
###Simply visit [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/applqpak/WhitelistReason-Nukkit/master/WhitelistReason.jar), and download the JAR. Now, drop it in your plugins folder and (re)start your Nukkit server!

##Some screenshots:

The FIRST ever plugin for Nukkit that allows you to set a custom whitelist message/reason (with colour)!

##Credits to @imJack for amazing help!
